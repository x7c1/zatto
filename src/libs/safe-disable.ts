/**
 * Wrap a sibling teardown call so a throw in one branch cannot strand the
 * others. The reload-harden PR introduces this helper because GNOME Shell
 * silently leaves a wedged extension running when `disable()` throws part
 * way through — the D-Bus name stays claimed, the next reload's
 * `register_object` collides, and the user sees "old code is still in
 * memory" with no clear log line pointing at the cause.
 *
 * Logs the throw under the `[Zatto]` prefix and swallows it. The `label`
 * appears in the log so a failure is attributable to a specific sibling
 * (inspector / reloader / overlayController / …).
